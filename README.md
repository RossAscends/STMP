## Installation

### Typical

1. Make sure [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system and has access through your firewall.
2. Clone this github repo. (`git clone https://github.com/RossAscends/STMP/` in a command line, or use a Github GUI like Github Desktop)
3. Setup the API (see below).
4. Run `STMP.bat` to install the required Node modules and start the server.
5. On the first run, the server will create an empty `secrets.json` and a default `config.json`, as well as the `/api-presets/` and `/chats/` folders.
6. Open `htttp://localhost:8181/` in your web browser.

### Docker

- STMP can also be installed via Docker, thanks to [city-unit](https://github.com/city-unit).
- The [Docker](https://www.docker.com) file can be found in `/utils/`

(instructions coming soon)

## API Setup

Currently STMP supports Text Completions (TC) and HordeAI, with TC active by default.

### Using Text Completions

- Obviously, the host must have a Text Completions compatible backend installed and working on their device.
- [TabbyAPI](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI) and [KoboldCPP](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp) are confirmed to work with STMP's TC API mode.
- STMP assumes the default server URL of `http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1/completions` for TC requests.
- **KoboldCPP should be run with the --multiUser flag enabled.**
- If your TC API requires a key, paste it into `secrets.json`.
- Other OpenAI-compatible TC APIs are being tested.

### Using Horde

- Using Horde requires a SillyTavern server to be running on your local machine to handle the Horde requests.
- **IMPORTANT: ST must be running with CSRF turned off.**
- **IMPORTANT:** STMP assumes you have BasicAuthentication enabled on your ST server, and requires you to input your `username:pass` into `secrets.json`.
- STMP assumes the default ST server URL of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/horde/generate-text` for Horde requests.
- If you have a HordeID set in SillyTavern, those credentials and kudos will be used.

### Changing API

- The Host can click the emoji icon at the top left to change which API is used.
- üìë = Text Completions
- üßü = Horde

## Multiuser Setup

This must be done AFTER completing all installation steps above.

1. Run `Remote-Link.cmd` to download (only one time, 57MB) and auto-run `cloudflared.exe` to get a randomly generated tunnel URL for your server.
2. Share the generated cloudflared URL with the guest users.
3. User will be able to directly and securely connect to your PC using the Cloudflare URL.

## Use

### Managing Characters

- Place any SillyTavern compatible character card into the `/characters/` folder and refresh the page.
- Character can be selected at the top of the AI Chat panel.
- If new characters are added while the server is running, the Host must refresh their browser page to see them.
- the AI character can be changed at any time without resetting the chat.

### Adding Presets

- If you want to add more presets for Instruct formats or hyperparameter Samplers, put the JSON file into the appropriate folder:
- Samplers go in `/public/api-presets/`
- Instruct formats go in`/public/instructFormats/`
- It's highly reccomended to review the structure of the default STMP preset files.
- SillyTavern preset files may not work, or may have unintended effects!

### Chatting

- Chatting can be done in either chat windows by typing into the appropriate box and then either pressing the Send button (‚úèÔ∏è), or pressing Enter.
- `Shift+Enter` can be used to add newlines to the input.
- [Markdown formatting](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Showdown%27s-Markdown-syntax) is respected.
- (‚ñ∂Ô∏è/‚è∏Ô∏è) allows for manual disconnect/reconnect to the server.

### Hosting

The host will see the following controls:

#### Control Panel (left side)

- Controls for changing API settings such as: `API` (Text Completions(üìë) or HordeAI(üßü)), `Context` size, `Response` length, `Sampler` presets, and `Instruct` formats
- `AutoAI` Toggle to determine whether the AI should respond to every user input, or only on command from the Host.
- A text box to define the `Final Instruction` to send as system at Depth 1 in the prompt.
- A list of past AI Chats, click to load one.
- (üîÑ) refreshes the Past AI Chats list (usually not necessary as it is auto-refreshed with each new AI chat message)
- (‚óÄÔ∏è) toggles visibility of the Host Control Panel.

#### AI Chat Header

- A selector to set the active AI character

#### In the Chat Windows

- (üóëÔ∏è) to clear either chat.

#### Top Right

- (üîë) opens a text box for input of the Host key in order to gain the Host role.
- once the key has been entered, the page will automatically refresh to show the host controls.
- **the Host key can be found in the server console at startup.**
- After the user enters the key and presses Enter, their page will refresh and they will see the Host controls.

#### AI Chat Input Bar

- (ü§ñ) Manually triggering an AI response without user Input
- (‚úÇÔ∏è) Deleting the last message in the AI Chat
- (üîÑ) Retry, i.e. Remove the last chat message and prompt the AI character to give a new response.

### Changing usernames

- Use the text boxes at the top of the screen to change your username(s) at any time.
- You can have a different name for the User Chat and AI Chat.
- Usernames are stored in browser localStorage.
- (‚õî) clears the saved Usernames and UniqueID from localStorage.

## Planned Features

### Core Functionality

- Smarter retry logic (add entity metadata to each chat message; only remove the last AI response)
- Custom OpenAI text completion compatible API endpoint selection

### Host Controls

- Toggle for locking AI chat for users? (this is already kind of done with AutoResponse off)
- Drag-sort list to set User Turn Order for AI chatting?
- Allow API key/Authentication information to be set via the UI.
- Ability to rename chats.
- ability to remove any message in the chat, not just the last.
- ability to edit the text of a chat
- ability for Host to edit a User's role from the UI
- ability to change the max length of chat inputs (currently 1000 characters)

### Low-priority but Nice-to-have Features

- Multiple AI characters active at once (group chats)
- Download chats as text, JSON, or SillyTavern-compatible JSONL?
- UI themes?
- Bridge extension for SillyTavern to enable intra-server communication.
