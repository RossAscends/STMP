# SillyTavern MultiPlayer (STMP)

SillyTavern MultiPlayer is an LLM chat interface that allows multiple users to chat together with one or more AI characters.
It also includes a sidebar chat for users only, and many tools for the Host to control the behavior of the AI and to moderate users.

## Installation

### Typical

1. Make sure [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system and has access through your firewall.
2. Clone this github repo into a new folder NOT the main SillyTavern folder. (`git clone https://github.com/RossAscends/STMP/` in a command line, or use a Github GUI like Github Desktop)
3. Run `STMP.bat` to install the required Node modules and start the server.
4. On the first run, the server will create an empty `secrets.json` and a default `config.json`, as well as the `/api-presets/` and `/chats/` folders.
5. Open `http://localhost:8181/` in your web browser.

### Docker

- STMP can also be installed via Docker, thanks to [city-unit](https://github.com/city-unit).
- The [Docker](https://www.docker.com) file can be found in `/utils/`

(instructions coming soon)

<!-- - Obviously, the host must have a Text Completions compatible backend installed and working on their device.
- [TabbyAPI](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI) and [KoboldCPP](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp) are confirmed to work with STMP's TC API mode.
- STMP assumes the default server URL of `http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1/completions` for TC requests.
- **KoboldCPP should be run with the --multiUser flag enabled.**
- If your TC API requires a key, paste it into `secrets.json`.
- Other OpenAI-compatible TC APIs are being tested. -->

### Using Horde

You can use Horde as an anonymous user, but that generally leads to slower response times.

To use your Horde API key in STMP, add it to `secrets.json` like this (server should run at least once):

```js
{
    // some content
    "horde_key": "YourKeyHere",
    // some other content
}
```

Don't have one? [Registering a HordeAI account is free and easy](https://horde.koboldai.net/register).

### Multiuser Setup

This must be done AFTER completing all installation steps above.

0. Make sure your STMP server is running.
1. Run `Remote-Link.cmd` to download `cloudflared.exe` (only one time, 57MB).
2. the Cloudflared server will auto-start and generate a random tunnel URL for your STMP server.
3. Copy the URL displayed in the middle of the large box in the center of the console window.
4. **DO NOT CLOSE THE CLOUDFLARE CONSOLE WINDOW**
5. Share the generated cloudflared URL with the guest users.
6. User will be able to directly and securely connect to your PC by opening the URL in their browser.

## Play

### Chatting

- User can change their display name at any time using either of the inputs at the top of the respective chat displays.
  - You can have a different name for the User Chat and AI Chat.
  - Usernames are stored in browser localStorage.
- Chatting can be done in either chat windows by typing into the appropriate box and then either pressing the Send button (‚úèÔ∏è), or pressing Enter.
- `Shift+Enter` can be used to add newlines to the input.
- [Markdown formatting](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Showdown%27s-Markdown-syntax) is respected.
- Some limited HTML styling is also possible inside user messages.
- Users with the Host role can hover over any chat message in either chats to see editing and deletion buttons.

The host will see the following controls:

## Control Panel (üéõÔ∏è)

### AI Controls

AI Config Section

- `Mode` can be clicked to switch between TC/CC mode, and HordeAI mode.
  - üìë = Completions
  - üßü = Horde
- `Context` defines how long your API prompt should be. Longer = more chat history sent, but slower processing times.
- `Response` defines how many tokens long the AI response can be.
- `Streaming` togles streamed responses on or off.
- `AutoAI` Toggle to determine whether the AI should respond to every user input, or only on command from the Host.
- `Instruct` sets the type of instruct sequences to use when crafting the API prompt.
- `Sampler` sets the hyperparameter preset, which affects the response style.
- `API` selector to choose which LLM API to use, and an `Edit` button to change its configuration.
- `Models` allows selection of models served by the connected API.

Insertions Section

- `System Prompt` defines what will be placed at the very top of the prompt.
- `Author Note(D4)` defines what will be inserted as a system message at Depth 4 in the prompt.
- `Final Instruction(D1, "JB")` defines what to send as a system message at Depth 1 in the prompt.

#### Adding/Editing APIs

Currently STMP supports Text Completions (TC), Chat Completions (CC), and HordeAI.

> STMP has been tested with the following APIs:
>
> - [TabbyAPI](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI)
> - [YALS](https://github.com/theroyallab/YALS)
> - [KoboldCPP](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)
> - [Aphrodite](https://github.com/PygmalionAI/aphrodite-engine)
> - [Oobabooga Textgeneration Webui](https://github.com/PygmalionAI/aphrodite-engine) (OpenAI compatible mode)
> - [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) is supported in CC mode.
> - OpenAI official API
> - Anthropic's Claude
>
> Other LLM backends that provide an Open AI compatible API should wotk with STMP.

1. Select `Add new API` from the `API` selector to open the API Editing panel.
2. A new panel will be displayed with new inputs:
  a. `Name` - the label you want to remember the API as
  b. `Endpoint URL` - this is the base server URL for the LLM API. If the usual URL does not work, try adding `v1/` to the end.
  c. `Key` - If your API requires a key, put it in here.
  d. `Endpoint Type` - select from Text Completions or Chat Completions as appropriate for the API endpoint.
  e. `Claude` - select this if the API is based on Anthropic's Claude model, because it needs special prompt formatting.
  f. `Close` - will cancel the API editing/creating process and return you to the main AI Config panel.
  g. `Test` - sends a simple test message to the API to get a response. This may not work on all APIs.
  h. `Save` - confirms the API addition/edit and saves it to the database.
  i. `Delete` - removes the APi from the database.
3. When all of the fields are filled out, press `Save` to return to the main Control panel display.

### Adding Presets

- If you want to add more presets for Instruct formats or hyperparameter Samplers, put the JSON file into the appropriate folder:
- Samplers go in `/public/api-presets/`
- Instruct formats go in`/public/instructFormats/`
- **It's highly reccomended to review the structure of the default STMP preset files.**
- **SillyTavern preset files will not work.**

## Chats, Characters, and Crowd Controls (üìú)

### Past Chats

- A list of past AI Chats, click one to load it.
- Information listed with each past session item:
  - AI characters in the chat history
  - Number of messages in AI Chat
  - Timestamp for the last message
- The list is ordered in reverse chronological (newest chats first)

### Managing Characters

- Place any SillyTavern compatible character card into the `/characters/` folder and restart the server.
- Drag-drop a v2 card spec character card over the chat to import.
- Characters can be added, removed, edited, or swapped out inside the üìú panel.
- **Changing the character roster does not require restting the chat.**

#### Editing Characters

- Hosts will see a (üß†) next to Character Selectors. This will open a popup with the character definitions.
- STMP handles three types of character definitions:
  - `Name` - What is displayed as the character's name in the chat.
  - `Description` - What goes into the prompt at either the top, or at D4 if 'D4 Char Defs' box is checked.
  - `First Message` - What gets auto-inserted into a new chat with that character.
- `Embedded Lorebook` - is currently not used by STMP, but is visible for user reference.
- (üëÅÔ∏è) at the top of the character definition panel will show Legacy Fields
  - Legacy Fields are **read-only**. STMP does not use them.
  - Legacy fields = Personality, Example Messages, and Scenario.
- `Save` will update the character definitions.
- `Close` will close the popup with no changes.

>Why are Personality, Scenario, and Example Messages considered 'Legacy'?

- Personality and Scenario are outdated distinctions without a meaningful purpose, and should be incorporated into the Description.
- Example Message can also be incorporated into the Description. We recommend doing so in the form of [AliChat](https://discord.com/channels/553948136629075968/1137875580457590884/1198559176935354508).

### Crowd Controls

- (üé®) (all users) Three inputs for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness to define the base color for STMP UI theming.
- (üé∂) (all users) is a toggle that will play/stop a looping background audio track ("Cup of COhee" be Deffcolony). This helps mobile keep their websocket connection active when they minimize the app.
- (ü§ê) is a toggle to completely disable guest inputs for both chats.
- (üñåÔ∏è) is a toggle to allow or deny markdown image display.
- (üì¢) lets the Host send a large notification to all connected users.

### User List

- The right side of the screen contains two users lists, one for each chat.
- Users with the Host role will have a üëë next to their name.
- The AI Characters will have a ü§ñ next to their names in the AI Chat User List.

## Top Bar Controls

- (üñºÔ∏è) toggles the chat windows between three modes: maximize AI chat >> maximize User Chat >> return to normal dual display.
- (üîÉ) forces a page refresh.
- (‚ñ∂Ô∏è/‚è∏Ô∏è) allows for manual disconnect/reconnect to the server.
- (üîë) opens a text box for input of the Host key in order to gain the Host role.
  - Once a vlid key has been entered, the page will automatically refresh to show the host controls.
  - **The Host key can be found in the server console at startup.**
  - After the user enters the key and presses Enter, their page will refresh and they will see the Host controls.
- (‚õî) clears the saved Usernames and UniqueID from localStorage.
  - If you are not the primary Host you will lose any roles you were given.
  - You will be asked to register a new username next time you sign in on the same browser.

## In-Chat Controls

### Top of Each Chat

- (üóëÔ∏è) Host only, Clears either chat.
  - clearing the AI Chat will automatically create a new chat with the selected Character.
- (üßπ) All users, visually clears the chat to reduce UI lag, but does not actually destroy anything.

### Above the AI Chat Input Bar (Host Only)

- (‚è≥) Sets the chat 'cooldown' for regular members.
  - During the delay period the (‚úèÔ∏è) for that chat will become (üö´), and no input will be possible.
- (ü§ñ) Manually triggering an AI response without user Input
- (‚úÇÔ∏è) Deleting the last message in the AI Chat
- (üîÑ) Retry, i.e. Remove the last chat message and prompt the AI character to give a new response.

## Planned Features

### Core Functionality

- ~~Smarter retry logic (add entity metadata to each chat message; only remove the last AI response)~~

### Host Controls

- ~~Toggle for locking AI chat for users? (this is already kind of done with AutoResponse off)~~
- Turn-based Mode with Drag-sort list to set input Order
- Ability to rename chats.
- ability for Host to edit a User's role from the UI
- ability to change the max length of chat inputs (currently 1000 characters)
- make control for AI replying every X messages
- make control for host, to autoclear chat every X messages
- ~~disallow names that are only spaces, punctuations, or non ASCII (non-Latin?) characters~~
  - ~~require at least 3? A-Za-z characters~~
- disallow registering of names that are already in the DB
- character creation in-app
- create instruct preset types in-app
- I/O for full app setup presets (includes: single API without key, )
- basic use of character-embedded lorebooks

### Quality of Life

- ~~make control for guests to clear DISPLAY of either chat (without affecting the chat database) to prevent browser lag~~
- auto-parse reasoning into a collapsable container
- highlight exact username matches in AI response with their color
- fade out users in user chat list who havent chatted in X minutes (add a css class with opacity 50%)
- fade out users in ai chat list who are no longer connected, or are faded out in user list (same)
- show which users in the User Chat are using which name in the AI Chat
- add a link to the User message that the AI is responding to at the top of each AI message.
- When an AI resposne is triggered by UserX's input, UserX sees that response highlighted in the chat
- add external folder selector to source characters from.

### Low-priority but Nice-to-have Features

- ~~Multiple AI characters active at once (group chats)~~
- export chats as text, JSON, or SillyTavern-compatible JSONL?
- ~~UI themes~~
- Bridge extension for SillyTavern to enable intra-server communication?
